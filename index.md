# Puzzle

A big fan of puzzles! I have page [Code Breaker](https://www.facebook.com/codebreakerth/) (in Thai language) and update it regularly (along with another admin)

I'm learning (i.e. copying) how to create a simple webapp for specific puzzles. Below is some:
* [Cyptic Crossword](./Crossword)

# Puzzle Hunt

A big fan of puzzle hunts!

My friend and I tried creating 4 short puzzle hunts [here](https://sites.google.com/view/puzzlehuntth). Google Sites is clunky, so I might migrate it to github page in the future.

I also tried forking a full puzzle hunt webapp [here](http://lemononmars.pythonanywhere.com/). I'd love to hold a full hunt event in the future!
